# top-100k-subreddits

A list of the 100,000 most popular subreddits on Reddit and the scripts used to generate it. I took the opportunity to scrape this data before Reddit makes their API paid.

## Download

Download `subreddits-2023-06-08-03-54-20.json.xz` and extract it with `xz -d subreddits-2023-06-08-03-54-20.json.xz`.

## Running

If you want to scrape it yourself for some reason, fill out the required `.env` file, install the requirements and run `scrape.py`.
